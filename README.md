# JMarcan.github.io: GitHub Blog

## Project description
This repository contains my [GitHub portfolio blog](https://jmarcan.github.io//) where I've so far published `Data Science Blog Post: The most profitable months on AirBnB Seattle`

The aim in this project was to setup my own Blog on GitHub and below I'm sharing how you can do the same and avoid pitfalls I've faced.
