To help you maximize your profit

and to follow my interest in Data-Science, Digital Platforms and Sharing Economy:
<br/><br/>
I've took AirBnB data of Seattle city published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) to answer the following questions:
1. How can landlord increase his income by increasing his activity on AirBnB?

2. When is the most profitable month to be landlord at AirBnB?

3. When is the most profitable month to be tenant at AirBnB?

## So, what data has to say about maximizing your profit at AirBnB Seattle?

### 1. Landlords responding early command higher prices for renting their houses

In comparision with landlords taking for response a 'few days or more':

- 4% higher rent commanded by landlords who respond 'within an hour'

- 9% higher rent commanded by landlords who respond 'within a few hours'

| host_response_time | price | % |
| a few days or more | 120.8\$ | 100% |
| within a day | 122.1\$ | 101% |
| within a few hours | 131.3\$ | 109% |
| within an hour | 125.1\$ | 104% |

### 2. Landlords in Seattle should keep their houses rented during summer months
### 3. Visitors of Seattle should consider postponing their visit to winter months

![Prices](/assets/what-data-says about-maximizing profit-at-AirBnB-Seattle/prices.png)
The most profitable time for landlords (and the most expensive one for tenants) was the summer time.

In contrast, during the winter months are average prices the lowest.

### Do you really need to do reconstruction and pause your rental income during the summer?
